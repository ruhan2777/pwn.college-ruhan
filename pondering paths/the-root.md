# Challenge Name
The Root

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UD2NplFOof1A7AiUPQ1bO8jROJt.QX4cTO0wyN2kjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UD2NplFOof1A7AiUPQ1bO8jROJt.QX4cTO0wyN2kjNzEzW}
hacker@paths~the-root:~$


```
## Incorrect tangents I went on
I thought i had to put the path as root/pwn
But should have directly written /root

## What I learned
Learned how to access a program directly that is in the root directory

## References 
No outside reference used
